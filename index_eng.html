            <h1>Eight Planets And A Star - And Pluto.</h1>
            <p>As displayed above, our home solar system consists of a central star and nine planets (though technically, Pluto is defined as a mere dwarf star). However, there is a lot more stuff floating around
                in this <strong>287.46 billion kilometers</strong> large (in diameter) cosmic phenomenon that we live in - as an example, there are an overwhelming <strong>575 known natural satellites, or moons</strong>,
                in this tiny little portion of the known universe. To put this into perspective - planet earth only has one moon! This fact shows how huge this conglomerate of celestial objects really is. Still, this
                massive system only represents a barely noticable fraction of the <strong>observable universe</strong>, or even the <strong>milky way</strong>. Our home galaxy, the milky way, is approximately 
                <strong>160,256,410 times wider</strong> (in diameter) than our solar system! To make things even more mind-blowing, the observable universe is (by todays speculations) around <strong>93 billion
                light years</strong> in diameter - approximately <strong>one million times</strong> larger than the milky way. Those numbers are barely comprehensible for the human mind, and it is truly impossible to
                imagine what undiscovered realms might exist in this seemingly empty space beyond our limited understanding. So in the following, let us dive deeper in the discoveries the human race has actually made,
                and take a closer look at the system of celestial objects that we so proudly call our home - our <strong>solar system.</strong>

            <p>The Sun is the central star of our solar system. It is by far the largest and heaviest object close to earth's proximity, causing other, smaller objects (like planets and asteroids) to rotate
                around it. Due to its immense mass - which is estimated to be around <strong>330 thousand</strong> times our earth's mass, or a whopping 99.86% of the solar system's total mass, this star can continously 
                force atoms to perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion">nuclear fusion</a> at its core. This reaction creates massive amounts of energy, causing the sun to emit light and heat - 
                however, nuclear fusion also causes <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation">nuclear radiation</a>, or radioactive waves. The sun's light and heat emissions have proven to be essential 
                for life to exist on planet earth, while the radiation this star emits would be devastating to our home planet if it didn't provide a protective shield (more on that in the earth section). Today's 
                research suggests that our solar system's central star has formed around <strong>4.6 billion years</strong> ago, and consists mostly of hydrogen and helium.<br>
                When looking at the sky, it would seem as though this massive burning object must be pretty close to our earth - we can feel the heat it emits, and the light blinds our eyes. However, the sun is around 
                <strong>147 million kilometers</strong> away from us (on average - depending mostly on the time of year). To put this into perspective, the very light that this star emits needs to travel for 
                <strong>8 minutes and 19 seconds</strong> to cover that distance! Theoretically speaking, if the sun suddenly were to stop existing, we would not know about that until an entire eight minutes after the 
                fact.<br> It is truly fascinating how this star effects our planet, even though it is so far away from us that we may never be able to fully understand the secrets this massive object holds.

            <h1>Mercury</h1>

            </div><div class="obj_text">
            <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system (since Pluto is not classified as a planet), and the closest to the Sun. Consequently, it also has the shortest orbit time, making a Mercury-year only 
                last for around <strong>88 days</strong>. Oddly enough, Mercury only rotates three times for every two full orbits around our home star, causing one day on this planet to almost as long as a year. 
                This celestial object gets its name from the roman deity, Mercury, the messenger of the gods.<br>
                Mercury is one of the four <strong>terrestrial planets</strong> in our solar system (alongside Venus, Mars, and the Earth), meaning it has a solid, rocky body. From what we can observe, Mercury appears 
                to have a solid core, surrounded by a liquid layer of iron, similar to our home planet in its structure. However, due to its small size and little weight, Mercury does not provide sufficient 
                gravitational force to hold an atmosphere. Its surface is a barren, rocky wasteland, though many craters can be seen all over it.<br>
                Another interestring aspect of this small celestial object can be observed in its surface temperature, which can reach anywhere between -170°C (on the dark, night side) and +430°C (on the day side). 
                Those massive differences can be explained by Mercuries slow rotation (and therefore, long day- and nighttimes), and the absence of an atmosphere (which would be able to contain heat radiating from 
                the Sun). Due to its composition - Mercury contains a higher percentage of iron than any other planet in our solar system) - this planet is surrounded by a very strong <strong>magnetic field</strong>. 
                Most of the information we have on Mercury were gathered through the <strong>Mariner 10</strong> and <strong>MESSENGER</strong> missions, sent from Earth by NASA.

            <p>The second planet from the sun is named after the roman goddess of love and beauty, and it is the second brightest object we can observe in our night sky (after the moon). Just like Mercury, Venus 
                does not have any moons - a feature shared only by these two mentioned planets. Another similarity to the messenger of gods lies in its slow rotation - in fact, a full rotation takes longer than an 
                entire year on Venus (around 243 Earth days for one Venus day, as oppsed to 225 Earth days for one Venus year). Unlike Mercury, however, Venus has a very dense atmosphere, consisting mostly of 
                carbon dioxide. Because of this, and its close proximity to the Sun, Venus is by far the <strong>hottest planet</strong> in our solar system (the mean surface temperature lies at approximately 462°C). 
                Because of the fact that this hot planet is so bright on our night sky, it is often referred to as the <strong>morning star</strong> or <strong>evening star</strong>.<br>
                Venus is also often called Earth's sister planet, a title given to this object because of its very similar size, weight, and proximity to our home planet. Dispite this, planet Venus still holds many 
                secrets that have yet to be discovered - the thick atmosphere makes it difficult to observe the surface. However, NASA missions suggest that, just like Mercury, Venus is mostly a rocky, desert-like 
                planet. Evidence also shows that the morning star has excessive <strong>volcanic activity</strong> occuring. Venus may be our sister planet, but it is almost impossible to imagine living in this hot, 
                burning hell. Another reason for that is the weak magnetic field surrounding Venus, resulting in massive bombardements of solar radiation on the surface.<br>
                The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_symbols">astronomical symbol</a> for Venus is the same as that used for the female gender in biology, often making this planet stand for femininity 
                - it is said that women come from Venus, whereas man come from Mars.

            <p>Our home is the third planet from the Sun, and is the <strong>only known object</strong> in the universe to harbor life.  This makes planet Earth quite unique from what we know, as there are many critical 
                features a planet must have to allow life (as we know it) to exist. One of these features is a strong <strong>magnetosphere</strong>, which can shield the surface from solar radiation. On earth, such a 
                shield is created by a <strong>solid iron core</strong>, surrounded by <strong>hot, liquid iron</strong>. This core is surrounded by lava, upon which several 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plate_tectonics">tectonic plates</a> float. Those tectonic plates are the main reason for mountains and valleys to form on the rocky surface, but are also the cause 
                of <strong>volcanic activity</strong> and <strong>earthquakes</strong>.<br>
                Slightly bigger than Venus, Earth is the largest of the four terrestrial planets in our solar system, providing just enough gravity to hold our atmosphere, and keep the moon in a steady orbit. This is 
                just as essential to life as our magnetosphere, since we would not be able to survive without a breathable atmosphere or a natural satellite which plays a major role in keeping the Earths rotation and tidal
                activity steady.<br>
                Another critical factor to the existance of life is found in the oceans, lakes and rivers scattered around the Earths surface. Liquid water is essential for life to evolve, at least that is what current 
                studies show. The abundance of water on our home planet - the <strong>blue planet</strong> - is a unique feature that distinguishes Earth from all other planets in our solar system. Even still, water only 
                represents around 1/4400 of Earths total mass.<br>
                It is truly amazing how life managed to evolve on this tiny little planet in this small corner of the universe, up to a point of a (relatively) intelligent species that makes new scientific discoveries on 
                a daily basis.

            </div><div class="obj_text">
            <p>Mars carries the name of the roman god of war, and it's astronomical symbol is the same as the male gender in biology. It is often referred to as the <strong>"red planet"</strong>, a name Mars gets from it's 
                reddish surface color - the cause for this is the large amount of iron oxide on the planet's surface. Because of the rather thin atmosphere surrounding the celestial object, and its close proximity to 
                the earth, this reddish appearance can even be observed from our home planet. Similar to Mercury and Venus, the rocky, desert-like surface shows an abundance of craters and valleys, but interestingly enough, 
                Mars appears to have <strong>polar ice caps</strong> just like planet Earth does.<br>
                The god of war is the secont smallest planet in our solar system, having only around <strong>11 %</strong> of Earth's mass. While in terms of size, mass - and therefore gravitational force - Venus is more 
                comperable to our home planet, a human visit to Mars seems a lot more likely. This is mainly due to the fact that surface conditions are much more manageble for modern engineering. In fact, the 
                <strong>Phoenix lander mission</strong> proved that the soil on the red planet's surface is quite comperable the the soil on Earth, suggesting that it would perhaps be suitable to grow various plants. 
                This, combined with the fact that water has been found on Mars, this planet is the most interesting celestial object when it comes to human colonialization (considering current technology). Unfortunately 
                though, Mars is not shielded with a magnetosphere, which would undoubtedly cause problems for human visitors. However, since Mars is further away from the Sun than Earth, solar radiation is significantly 
                weaker than on our moon, and mankind has already set foot on our only natural satellite decades ago. The biggest problem we are facing when considering an expedition is the distance - with current technology, 
                flying a spaceship to Mars would take almost a <strong>year</strong> in travel time alone.<br>
                The red planet is orbited by two moons, <strong>Phobos</strong> and <strong>Deimos</strong>, both of which are significantly smaller than Earth's natural satellite.

            </div><div class="obj_text">
            <p>Jupiter is by far the largest planet in our solar system. It's mass is estimated to be around <strong>two and a half</strong> times that of the other planets' combined. This fact causes Jupiter's gravitational 
                force to effect other nearby objects massively - we can even measure these effects on planet Earth! Jupiter's name comes from the roman god of the sky and thunder - the king of all gods in ancient roman religion. 
                Unlike the four planets closest to our Sun, Jupiter does not have a solid surface - this giant is mostly made out of gases like hydrogen and helium. There may also be a solid core, but currently we lack the 
                technology to either prove or disprove that theory.<br>
                The atmosphere on this gas giant is hostile to all known life forms to say the least - humongous storms have been, and will continue, raging on this planet for millions of years. One of these massive tornadoes is the 
                prominent <strong>great red spot</strong>, which has already been observed in the 17th century by telescope. Due to those extreme conditions, and lack of a solid surface to land on, it proves to be difficult to 
                further investigate this mysterious giant.<br>
                Another one of Jupiter's many impressive features is the amount of moons that orbit this planet - so far we have discovered a whopping <strong>79 moons</strong> captured by the king of god's gravity, the largest 
                of which is <strong>bigger than Mercury</strong>, the smallest of our solar system's planets. Due to it's massive size, Jupiter is the second brightest planet that can be seen on the night sky from Earth (after 
                Venus), dispite the fact that it is approximately three times further away from us than Mars (on average).<br>
                Expeditions to Jupiter are likely to be inderect ones, since landing un-manned spacecrafts on one of it's many moons seems very possible in the foreseeable future, while directly entering Jupiter's brutal 
                atmosphere would completely destroy all electronic equipment we are able to produce in an instant.

            <p>Similar to Jupiter, Saturn is a massive gas giant orbited by an abundance of moons (we have discovered <strong>82 satellites</strong> surrounding this planet). <strong>Titan</strong>, Saturn's largest moon, is 
                the only known satellite in our solar system with a substantial atmosphere. However, Saturn's most prominent feature has to be its <strong>ring system</strong>, which consists mostly of ice crystals, rock debris 
                and dust.<br>
                The name Saturn originates, again, in roman culture - in ancient roman mythology, Saturn was known as the god of agriculture and wealth. Its astronomical symbol represents the god's sickle.<br>
                Saturn's yellow-ish color can be explained with its outer atmosphere's composition, which holds a large amount of <strong>ammonia crystals</strong>. However, like most other known gas giants, Saturn's atmosphere 
                consists mostly of hydrogen and helium. Current observations suggest that this planet might have a solid core, though - just like with Jupiter - this is very difficult to prove.<br>
                Since Saturn is around <strong>ten times</strong> (approximately 1.4 billion km, as opposed to 149 million km) further away from the Sun, a full orbit, or year, takes roughly 30 Earth years. However, 
                Saturn's rotational speed is quite fast compared to the Earth - current research suggests that one Saturn day lasts for about 10 hours and 30 minutes (though there are no exact measures yet).<br>
                As of yet, exploration of this impressive gas giant have only been made from distant observation and three flyby missions - Pioneer 11 (1979), Voyager (1980) and Cassini-Huygens (2004). In the future, space 
                explorers consider sending un-manned spaceships to one of Saturn's moons, or even closer flyby missions.

            <p>The seventh planet from our Sun is the also the third-largest (after Juputer and Saturn), but only the fourth-heaviest (both Jupiter and Saturn, but also Neptune having more total mass). Technically, Uranus 
                is classified as a <strong>gas giant</strong> (just like Jupiter and Saturn), but due to the fact that its atmosphere contains large amounts of water, methane and ammonia, scientists often refer to Uranus 
                (and Neptune) as <strong>ice giants</strong>. Another interesting fact about this massive planet is its <strong>axis of rotation</strong> - which is tilted almost 90° "sideways", meaning its poles are locationed 
                where you would expect its equator should be.<br>
                The name of this giant is often joked about, but it actually references the ancient greek deity of <strong>the sky</strong>, rather than what you would expect. Just like Jupiter and Saturn, 
                Uranus is visible to the naked eye from Earth when looking at the night sky - that is if it is the correct time. Due to the large distance from our home star, Uranus takes around <strong>84 Earth years</strong> 
                to perform a full orbit around the Sun. However, Uranus rotates rather quickly around its own axis - around 17 hours for a full rotation at its core, but at some altitudes less than 14 hours on its surface. This 
                is due to the fact that Uranus can cause <strong>massive gas storms</strong>!<br>
                Because of its unusual axis of rotation, Uranus' magnetosphere causes a corkscrew-like tail behind its movement - another phenomenon we need to take into consideration when performing expeditions moving behind 
                Uranus.<br>
                Like with Jupiter and Saturn, Uranus' massive gravitational force can capture a large amount of natural satellites - <strong>27 moons</strong> have so far been discovered orbiting this planet. Some of these might 
                potentially be used to land discovery missions upon, since it is a lot saver to explore Uranus from a distance.

            <p>Unlike the other three gas giants in our solar system, Neptune cannot be seen from Earth with the unaided, naked eye. This is mainly because of its large distance to the Sun, and, consequently, our home planet. 
                Because of this, it is the only planet in our solar system that was first predicted by mathematical calculations rather than empirical observation. Until now, only one spacecraft has ever visited this ice giant - 
                <strong>Voyager 2</strong> (which also remains to be the only mission to have ever visited Uranus).<br>
                Neptunes name has its origin in ancient roman mythology, where Neptune was believed to be the <strong>god of the sea</strong> (though, when it was discovered in 1612, it was at first simply called "the 
                planet exterior to Uranus"). The name "Neptune" is undoubtedly very fitting though, since this ice giant's core and atmosphere contain large amounts of water - most of which is eather frozen solid or crystallized 
                gas.<br>
                Just like we can observe on other known gas giants, Neptune produces massive gas storms on its surface, with wind speeds reaching speeds up to <strong>2200 km/h</strong>. Because of this (and the large distance to 
                Earth), with current technology we are only able to explore this planet by flyby missions or from huge distances via telescope. In the future, however, mankind might be able to create a robotic observation 
                station on one of Neptunes 14 known moons. One of these interesting natural satellites is <strong>Triton</strong>, which is by far the largest of Neptune's moons, comprising more than 99.5% of the mass in orbit 
                around its native planet.

            <p>Pluto is one of the known <strong>icy dwarves</strong> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_belt">kuiper belt</a>, a large, disc-shaped ring in the outer solar system composed mostly of different 
            ices, but also rocks and small planet-like objects. Another one of these objects was discovered in 2005: <strong>Eris</strong>, which surprisingy is 27% more massive than Pluto - this discovery led to the re-evaluation 
            of the term "planet", and the declaration of Pluto being a <strong>minor planet</strong>, or dwarf planet. Though controversial, this term is rather fitting, considering the fact that Pluto's mass is only 
            one-sixth that of our Earth's moon. Dispite its small size and low weight, we have found <strong>five moons</strong> orbiting this tiny celestial object. One of those, <strong>Charon</strong>, has slighly more than 
            half the diameter of Pluto, which has a large effect on the planetoid's rotation and movement - it almost looks like Pluto is "dancing" with Charon.<br>
            One of the most interesting facts about this minor planet lies in its name - or rather, how it was recieved. After thousands of suggestions were rejected, Pluto was named after the ancient <strong>god of the 
            underworld</strong>, proposed by <strong>Venetia Burney</strong>, an eleven-year-old schoolgirl!<br>
            Due to its large distance to the Sun, Pluto's surface resembles a deep-frozen wasteland, which we got a close look at in 2015, when NASA's "new horizons" mission flew by the icy dwarf. This huge distance to its 
            home star also means the Pluto requires around <strong>248 Earth-years</strong> for one full orbit. Interestingly, Pluto's orbit is a lot more "oval" than those of the eight planets mentioned earlier, and its orbit 
            is tilted around 17° sideways. Another strange fact about this dwarf is its rotation around its own axis, which takes around 6400 Earth days, meaning that one day on Pluto equals almost 18 Earth years.
